# Upload to GitHub - Step by Step

## Commands to Run (Copy and paste these ONE AT A TIME)

Open your Terminal and run these commands in order:

### 1. Go to your project folder
```bash
cd "/Users/davidwright/Desktop/untitled folder/FieldLink v5"
```

### 2. Stage all your files
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Create your first commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: FieldLink v5 ready for deployment"
```

### 4. Connect to your GitHub repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/davidwright12092-create/fieldlink-v5.git
```

### 5. Rename branch to main
```bash
git branch -M main
```

### 6. Upload to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** When you run step 6, GitHub might ask for your username and password. If it does:
- Username: `davidwright12092-create`
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your regular GitHub password)

If you need a token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "FieldLink"
4. Check "repo" permissions
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password

After all commands succeed, your code will be on GitHub! âœ…
