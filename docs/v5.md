# FieldLink v5 - Development Handoff Documentation

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Plain English summary of changes and required fixes for developer handoff

---

## What Was Changed

### Database Simplification
- Switched from PostgreSQL/Supabase to SQLite (local file-based database)
- Reduced from 7 database tables down to just 2 tables (User and Recording)
- Removed multi-tenant features (organizations, teams, invitations)
- Removed separate tables for transcriptions and analysis results
- All analysis data now stored directly in Recording table as JSON strings

### File Storage Change
- Changed from AWS S3 cloud storage to local filesystem
- Audio files now stored in `uploads/recordings/` folder structure
- No cloud dependencies or AWS credentials needed

### AI Processing Updates
- Switched from OpenAI Whisper to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription
- Added speaker identification (diarization) - identifies who is speaking when
- Uses AI to determine which speaker is the Technician vs Customer
- Consolidated multiple API calls into fewer requests for cost savings
- Switched from GPT-4 to GPT-4o Mini for analysis (cheaper)

### UI/UX Changes
- Redesigned recording detail page from 5 tabs down to 3 tabs
- Added new "Conversation" tab with 2-column layout
- Left side shows conversation transcript with speaker labels
- Right side shows analytics summary (sentiment, topics, action items)
- Removed separate Overview and Coaching tabs
- Audio player integrated with conversation view for playback sync

### Authentication Simplification
- Removed role-based access control (admin/manager/user roles)
- Removed organization-based permissions
- Simplified to basic user authentication only

---

## Current State of Application

### What Works
- Frontend UI looks great and displays properly
- Backend API is fully functional
- Database is set up and migrations are applied
- File upload infrastructure is in place
- OpenAI integration is configured

### What Doesn't Work (Critical Issues)

#### Issue 1: Frontend Uses Mock Data Only
**Problem:** The entire frontend application is using hardcoded demo data and never makes actual API calls to the backend.

**Details:**
- Login and signup create fake tokens instead of calling backend authentication
- All recording pages show mock data instead of fetching real data
- Upload component exists but isn't fully connected
- Backend APIs are ready but never get called

**Impact:** App looks like it works but no real data flows through the system.

---

#### Issue 2: Database Schema Doesn't Match Code
**Problem:** The code expects database fields that don't exist, and tries to create tables that weren't set up.

**Details:**
- Code tries to access user role, organization ID, and active status fields
- Database only has basic user fields (email, password, first name, last name)
- Code tries to create Organization records but table doesn't exist
- Authentication tokens expect role and organization data that isn't in database

**Impact:** Backend will crash when trying to register or login users.

---

#### Issue 3: Port Configuration Mismatch
**Problem:** Frontend and backend are configured to run on different ports in different files.

**Details:**
- Backend is set to port 5001 in one place, defaults to 5000 in another
- Frontend expects backend on port 5001 but proxy points to 5000
- Some API calls default to 5000, others to 5001

**Impact:** Frontend cannot connect to backend, all API calls fail.

---

#### Issue 4: Endpoint Names Don't Match
**Problem:** Frontend calls different endpoint names than what backend provides.

**Details:**
- Frontend calls `/auth/signup`, backend has `/auth/register`
- Frontend expects status values like "uploaded" and "transcribing"
- Backend uses status values "PROCESSING" and "COMPLETED"

**Impact:** Signup doesn't work, status displays incorrectly.

---

#### Issue 5: Data Structure Mismatches
**Problem:** Frontend expects different data structures than backend provides.

**Details:**
- Frontend expects single `fullName` field, backend sends `firstName` and `lastName`
- Frontend expects `companyName`, backend uses `organizationName`
- Frontend expects S3 storage fields, backend uses local file paths
- Response format differences cause data to not display

**Impact:** User information and recording data can't be displayed properly.

---

## What Needs to Be Fixed (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Core Fixes (Must Do First)
1. **Standardize port configuration** - Pick port 5001 and update all config files
2. **Fix database schema** - Either add missing fields to database OR remove references from code
3. **Connect authentication** - Replace mock login/signup with real API calls
4. **Fix endpoint naming** - Make frontend use `/auth/register` or backend accept `/auth/signup`
5. **Align data structures** - Make frontend and backend use same field names

### Priority 2: Integration Fixes (Do Second)
6. **Remove mock data** - Delete hardcoded data from all frontend pages
7. **Connect recording pages** - Make pages fetch real data from backend
8. **Fix file upload** - Ensure full upload workflow is connected
9. **Align status values** - Use same status names in frontend and backend
10. **Test complete flows** - Verify login → upload → view recording works end-to-end

### Priority 3: Polish (Do Last)
11. **Add error handling** - Proper error messages throughout
12. **Add loading states** - Show spinners while data loads
13. **Clean up code** - Remove unused files and commented-out code
14. **Test edge cases** - Invalid inputs, network errors, etc.

## Recommended Approach

### Option A: Quick Fix (1-2 days)
- Keep database simple (no roles, no organizations)
- Remove all organization/role code from backend
- Connect frontend to basic auth and recording APIs
- Get minimal viable product working

### Option B: Complete Fix (3-5 days)
- Update database schema to include all expected fields
- Keep organization and role features
- Fully integrate frontend and backend
- Production-ready application

---

## Decision Points for Developer

**1. Database Strategy**
- Option A: Keep it simple - remove organization features
- Option B: Add Organization table and role fields back

**2. Port Configuration**
- Standardize on port 5001 (recommended since backend .env already set)

**3. Mock vs Real Data**
- Should remove all mock data and connect to real APIs

**4. Scope**
- Decide if organization/role features are needed or can be removed

## Files That Need Changes

### Backend Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - User registration/login
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware
- `src/utils/jwt.ts` - Token generation
- `src/server.ts` - Server startup and port config

### Frontend Files
- `.env` - API URL configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Development server proxy
- `src/services/api.ts` - API client configuration
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication logic
- `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` - Login page
- `src/pages/auth/SignupPage.tsx` - Signup page
- `src/pages/recording/RecordingDetailPage.tsx` - Recording display
- `src/pages/recording/RecordingsPage.tsx` - Recording list
- `src/components/recording/RecordingUpload.tsx` - Upload component

---

## Environment Setup Needed

### Backend Requirements
- Node.js installed
- SQLite database (already exists)
- OpenAI API key (already configured)
- Google Cloud credentials (optional - mock data available)

### Frontend Requirements
- Node.js installed
- Environment variable for API URL

### To Run Application
1. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev` (should run on port 5001)
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (runs on port 3000)
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing Checklist

After fixes are complete, verify:
- [ ] User can register new account
- [ ] User can login with credentials
- [ ] User can logout and return to login page
- [ ] User can upload audio file
- [ ] Upload shows real progress
- [ ] Recording appears in list after upload
- [ ] Recording shows processing status
- [ ] Recording completes and shows analysis
- [ ] Conversation tab displays transcript with speakers
- [ ] Analytics sidebar shows sentiment and topics
- [ ] Audio player syncs with conversation view
- [ ] All navigation works without errors

## Summary

The application has great UI/UX design and solid architecture, but the frontend and backend were built separately and never fully integrated. The main work is connecting the two systems together, fixing configuration mismatches, and ensuring data structures align. The backend is functional and the frontend looks great - they just need to be properly wired together.

**Estimated Time:** 1-5 days depending on scope decision
**Complexity:** Medium (mostly configuration and integration work, not complex logic)
**Risk Level:** Low (no major architectural changes needed)
